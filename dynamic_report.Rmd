## Residential Cat Interaction Data
### How many unique cats are in the local area? How often are they pet?

This experiment aims to evaluate, on a rough average, how many residential cats there are in the area. It is also analysed how many of these cats were pet, with a main focus on if people have an enjoyable experience with neighborhood felines.

From the data that was collected, two graphs were produced.

The data of fig.1 represents how many unique cats were pet on one instance of travel (x-axis) and how many times this amount of unique cats were pet (y-axis).

The data of fig.2 represents the scores that people rated their cat experiences during one instance of travel (x-axis) and how many times this score was selected (y-axis).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3eSKCtfLyYWu9s8JLARrpgYJ4JtcAWCguupktDCNUIxWxsnsbjN4oLw9nNTVqgRBZgKl71zZTtKKj/pub?output=csv") 

  latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(time_submitted = 1) %>%
  rename(cat_experience_rating = 2) %>%
  rename(number_of_cats = 3) %>%
  rename(number_of_petted_cats = 4)
  
  ggplot(data = latest_data) +
   geom_bar (aes(x = number_of_petted_cats), fill = "#B2C248") +
     labs(title = "Fig.1 How many times were a unique amount of cats petted?",
          subtitle = "And the amount of times that number of Unique cats were petted",
          Caption = "Source: Residential Cat Spotting Study",
          x = "number_of_petted_cats (0 or 0+)",
          y = "amount of times")
  
  ggplot(data = latest_data) +
   geom_bar (aes(x = cat_experience_rating), fill = "#442343") +
     labs(title = "Fig.2 Cat Sighting/Encounter Enjoyability Rating", 
          subtitle = "Ranging from 1 - 10",
          Caption = "Source: Residential Cat Spotting Study",
          x = "cat_experience_rating (1-10)",
          y = "Number of Scores")
  
  cat_experience_rating <- latest_data$cat_experience_rating
  
  mean_score <- cat_experience_rating %>% mean() %>% round(2)
  
  amount_of_scores <- cat_experience_rating %>% length()
  
```

After my data was collected, in order to  summarise two important details of my graphs, I have created dynamic phrases.
Taking into account all of the cat interaction score ratings, the mean interaction score rating is **`r mean_score`** out of 10. 

Tallying up all the submissions in the form I used for my investigation, **`r amount_of_scores`** score ratings were submitted.
