# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in a double major between Biology and Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 to learn data collection, analysing and computing techniques which will be essential for my future in Ecology Field Research.
- I am interested in learning about digital and computing techniques which will serve as useful tools for my future studies and career.
