# stats220

### My name is Charley Wollerton, and this is my repo for STATS 220!
### Here is a little about myself:

- I am undertaking a *Bachelor of Science* degree double majoring in **Biology and Statistics**.
- I am taking STATS 220 to learn data collection, analysing and computing techniques that will be essential for my future in *Ecology Field Research*.
- I am interested in learning about **digital and computing techniques** which will serve as useful tools for my future studies and career.

## Details about my interests:

1. **Biology** - What I am most passionate about is Biology, I love getting outside and performing field research observing patterns involving *organisms in their habitats within an ecosystem*. My last field research I conducted was performed at [Maungauika, North Heads](https://www.myguideauckland.com/things-to-do/north-head-historic-reserve).
2. **Statistics** - I am an ardent lover of statistics. I love analysing patterns of data, associating relationships between data sets, making statistically sound graphical representations of data and making causal claims.
3. **Marine Ecology** - My favourite component of ecological is the marine wildlife which inhabit the intertidal zone on our coasts, such as the extraordinarily resistant [Periwinkle](https://www.britannica.com/animal/periwinkle-marine-snail), a type of common sea snail!

Here is a funny gif/meme that shows how I feel about studying Stats220!
